        <h1>Character Creation</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Truth is a thing which only appears to those who have observed, considered, and made a choice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Step 1: Character</h2>

        <p>Characters begin with 15 MXP to distribute freely among their Mental Attributes.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Issue</h2>

        <p>Write up your character’s background, personality and Issue. A character’s Issue is very important as it defines some mechanical aspects of your character. An Issue is an overarching theme, problem or mystery that the character feels they must solve and cannot just move on from. Once you have the important elements of your Issue get it checked with the GM to see if it’s appropriate. If your Issue is approved read the descriptions of each Arcana and decide which fits your Issue the most. No two PCs can be the same Arcana.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Persona</h2>

        <p>Characters begin one Persona of their Arcana.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Health and Spirit</h2>

        <p>Characters begin with either 9 maximum Health and 6 maximum Spirit or 6 maximum Health and 9 maximum Spirit.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Equipment</h2>

        <p>Characters begin with 1000 Yen. This can be spent freely during character creation.</p>

        <h1>Character</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I am thou... thou art I.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Each PC has a Level and several Mental Attributes. Level affects what personae you can use and Mental Attribute Level affect your competence in social encounters.</p>

        <h2>Character Level</h2>

        <p>By acquiring CXP (Character eXPerience) your Level increases. CXP can be gained through battles and at the discretion of the GM. Some may even choose to forego the CXP system completely, giving the GM free reign over how PCs develop. To Level Up you must have 5 CXP. Battles will generally award more than 1 CXP and extra CXP carries over to the next Level (it is possible to Level Up multiple times from a single battle). You can only obtain Personae whose Level is equal to or below yours</p>

        <h2>Mental Attribute</h2>

        <p>The minimum Mental Attribute Level is 2 and the maximum is 6. MXP (Mental eXPerience) is specifically tied to a single Mental Attribute, depending on how it is gained. MXP is awarded when a PC performs a Mental Attribute Check, regardless of its success/failure. MXP can also be gained through miscellaneous activities such as reading books. A Mental Attribute Levels Up when it has 10 MXP. Depending on how extreme the display is, MXP is generally awarded in packets of 1 or 2 at a time. The Mental Attributes are:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Going against what frightens or grieves you. </li>
        <li><strong>Diligence:</strong> Persistently and autonomously working.</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Having insight into something or someone. </li>
        <li><strong>Expression:</strong> Charismatically expressing your opinions.</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> The broadness of your pool of information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mental Attribute Check</h3>

        <p>A Mental Attribute Check is a time where a Mental Attribute is tested and can lead to success/failure. When a PC tries to perform an action that requires above average Courage, Diligence, Understanding, Expression or Knowledge they must roll 1d6. If the result is equal to or lesser than the PC’s Mental Attribute Level it is a success and goes according to plan. If the result is above the PC’s Mental Attribute Level the action is a failure and goes according GM discretion (e.g. the PC starts crying, falls asleep while doing homework, jokes about a sensitive subject, makes an inane and vague comment, says a political figure is a ballerina). The extent of the failure should be in scale to how badly the PC failed mechanically.</p>

        <h2>Health and Spirit</h2>

        <p>Every time you Level Up, choose either Health or Spirit and increase that maximum by 1. Every 10th Level, instead of choosing, increase both by 1.</p>

        <h1>Persona</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I am thou... thou art I.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Each Persona has a Level and several Combat Attributes. Level affects the Persona’s Combat Attributes and known Skills. Combat Attributes affect the potency of attacks and defences.</p>

        <h2>Persona Level</h2>

        <p>Whenever a PC gains CXP, this same amount is also given to their currently equipped Persona. The first time a Persona Levels Up it must have 5 CXP. Every Level after this point requires 2 additional CXP. Extra CXP from Levelling Up carries over to the next Level (it is possible to Level Up multiple times from a single battle). Personae unlock skills at certain Levels. A Persona’s Combat Attributes rise after a certain number of Level Ups.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>3 Level Ups:</strong> +1 Primary Combat Attribute</li>
        <li><strong>6 Level Ups:</strong> +1 Secondary Combat Attributes </li>
        <li><strong>8 Level Ups:</strong> +1 All Combat Attributes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Combat Attributes</h2>

        <p>Personae have a set of Combat Attributes which modify their ability in battle. Here is an overview of what Combat Attributes effect (each of these is expanded upon in the Combat section):</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength (STR):</strong> Melee Damage/Accuracy, Physical Skill Damage/Accuracy </li>
        <li><strong>Magic (MAG):</strong> Magic Damage, Magic Accuracy, Magic Defence </li>
        <li><strong>Endurance (END):</strong> Damage Reduction</li>
        <li><strong>Agility (AGI):</strong> Ranged Accuracy, Ranged Defence, Melee Defence</li>
        <li><strong>Luck (LUCK):</strong> Ailment Accuracy/Defence</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p>Personae have a set of Skills which they use to battle. Each Skill is an ability that can heal/deal damage and/or incur effects. A Persona cannot know more than 6 Skills at a time. If a new Skill is unlocked it cannot be used until another Skill is forgotten.</p>

        <h2>Stock</h2>

        <p>Each PC can keep 3 Personae in their Stock and exchange them freely with other PCs when out of battle. During battle you cannot exchange Personae with other PCs. At the start of battle you must choose a Persona to be equipped but during your turn you can swap Persona. You can only use the Skills and Combat Attributes of the currently equipped Persona.</p>

        <h1>Social Link</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>These genuine bonds... shall be your eyes to see the truth.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>A Social Link is a relationship shared by the Party. Each Social Link has several Ranks representing how well you know that person and each Rank has its own rewards. Every member of the Party can assist in the development of a Social Link. Each PC has their own Social Link as well that operates in the same way as NPC Social Links. Each Social Link has its own Issue, an overarching subplot that must be “resolved” before reaching Rank 10.</p>

        <h2>Arcana</h2>

        <p>Each Social Link is represented by an Arcana. The Arcana is whichever best represents the themes of the character and/or the Issue they face. A PC’s Original Persona’s Arcana is the same as their Social Link Arcana. Always get the GM to approve of your Arcana selection.</p>

        <h2>Social Link Rank</h2>

        <p>The maximum Social Link Rank is 10. A Social Link Rank goes up whenever the PC(s) and that character experience a serious leap in friendship. For every Rank a Social Link has, when you fuse Personae of that Arcana, you may add up to that Rank in CXP to that Persona. For every three Ranks a Social Link has, all Personae of that Arcana gain +1 to all Combat Attributes. PC Social Link Ranks improve their function in battle:</p>

        <h3>Rank 1</h3>

        <p>If an ally would die from a single-target attack/skill you may protect them, allowing them to ignore all damage from that attack and killing you instantly.</p>

        <h3>Rank 3</h3>

        <p>When a Shadow within Melee Attack range gains the Down condition you get a free Melee Attack against them.</p>

        <h3>Rank 5</h3>

        <p>When you have a 1 More! chance you may choose to remove the Down condition from an ally instead of attacking.</p>

        <h3>Rank 7</h3>

        <p>When you have a 1 More! chance you may choose to remove any single condition from an ally instead of attacking.</p>

        <h3>Rank 9</h3>

        <p>If you would die from an attack/skill you may ignore all damage from that attack. You can only do this once per battle. This cannot be used to survive protecting an ally using the Rank 1 ability.</p>

        <h3>Rank 10</h3>

        <p>You acquire a personalized Ultimate Persona similar to your Original Persona. It has an additional Immunity to an Element of your choice and it doesn’t have a Weakness. The Persona is designed by the GM and may not necessarily be awarded instantly, instead being given at a later Level.</p>

        <h1>Arcana</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Do you believe in fortune telling?
          The Arcana represent many things. Every Persona and Social Link is tied to a certain Arcana. The Arcana are derived from the tarot deck. The 21 Arcana used in Persona Wildcard are:</p>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
        <li>(0) Fool: Beginnings, spontaneity, faith, embracing folly.</li>
        <li>(1) Magician: Action, self-awareness, concentration, power.</li>
        <li>(2) Priestess: Inaction, subconscious, seeing potential, mystery.</li>
        <li>(3) Empress: Mothering, abundance, senses, nature.</li>
        <li>(4) Emperor: Fathering, structure, authority, regulation.</li>
        <li>(5) Hierophant: Education, belief, conformity, group membership. </li>
        <li>(6) Lovers: Relationships, sexuality, personal beliefs, personal morals. </li>
        <li>(7) Chariot: Victory, determination, assertion, self-control.</li>
        <li>(8) Strength: Strength, patience, compassion, gentle control.</li>
        <li>(9) Hermit: Introspection, searching, guidance, solitude.</li>
        <li>(10) Fortune: Destiny, opportunity, change, perspective.</li>
        <li>(11) Justice: Justice, responsibility, careful decision-making, cause and effect. </li>
        <li>(12) Hanged Man: Release, reversing, suspending, sacrifice.</li>
        <li>(13) Death: Ends, transition, frugality, eliminating excess, inevitability.</li>
        <li>(14) Temperance: Moderation, balance, well-being, synthesis.</li>
        <li>(15) Devil: Submission, materialism, ignorance, pessimism.</li>
        <li>(16) Tower: Sudden change, outburst, downturn, revelation.</li>
        <li>(17) Star: Optimism, inspiration, generosity, serenity.</li>
        <li>(18) Moon: Fear, illusion, imagination, disorientation.</li>
        <li>(19) Sun: Enlightenment, glory, vitality, self-assurance.</li>
        <li>(20) Judgement: Judgement, rebirth, calling, absolution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Persona Fusion</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Ah, this must be... the wild card.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Persona Fusion can only be done at some type of waypoint where you aren’t being threatened. Persona Fusion is recommended for advanced players. To avoid slowing down regular game-play I would also recommend only Fusing between sessions, let the GM know beforehand though. For the purposes of Fusion calculation, treat the number attached to Arcana as if it was 1 higher (this is so that the Fool Arcana is not equal to 0).</p>

        <h2>Fusing Personae</h2>

        <p>Fusing Personae destroys them and creates a new Persona. The Personae that are destroyed are referred to as Material Personae. Material Personae can be contributed by anyone, so you aren’t limited to the three in your stock. Only one of the resulting Persona is created though so you must choose who is given it.</p>

        <h2>Inheriting Skills</h2>

        <p>Each Persona has an Inheritance Skill. When a Persona is fused you may choose for it to know any of the Material Personae’s Inheritance Skills, regardless of whether or not the Material Personae actually have the Skill in its current list of known Skills.</p>

        <h2>Result</h2>

        <p>Two things are important in Material Personae for determining the result: the Material Personae’s Level and Arcana. The Arcana of the resulting Persona is calculated by adding or taking the number attached to each Material Personae’s Arcana until you have a result equal to or greater than 1. If the result is higher than 22, minus it by 22 (so that 23 = 1, 24 =2 and so on). The resulting Persona’s Arcana is that which is associated with this number. Average the Levels of the Material Personae, the Persona of the result Arcana that is closest to this Level is the Persona created through Fusion. If the Level of the resulting Persona is higher than the PC’s Level it cannot be created until they reach that Level. For every number of Material Personae used higher than 2, increase the average Level by 5. Always round up.</p>

        <h2>Fusing More or Less?</h2>

        <p>In general, Fusing more Personae is better than Fusing less. By using more than two Material Personae you have more choice of Arcana because you can add and minus the Arcana numbers in more combinations, the Level of the Persona will be higher from the +5 bonuses and you have more choices of Inheritance Skills. However there is the danger of having too few Personae because although having one great Persona is a good thing it leaves you vulnerable to its weaknesses and you lack versatility.</p>

        <h1>Shuffle Time</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>It seems we have a guest with an intriguing destiny...</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Shuffle Time is the primary way PCs will acquire new Personae. Shuffle Time is triggered at the end of every battle. For extra immersion, advice is included in this section on how to conduct Shuffle Time using actual tarot cards but they aren’t necessary.</p>

        <h2>Personae</h2>

        <p>Certain Personae cannot be acquired via Shuffle Time. Original and Ultimate Personae cannot be gained via Shuffle Time. The Personae available in the Shuffle are selected randomly within 10 Levels below the Party.</p>

        <h2>Shuffle Time</h2>

        <p>There are 1d6 cards placed on the table. Of these, 1d3 are Personae (represent them with their Arcana). Shuffle these cards where the players cannot see then spread them face down on the table and let them choose one card. If it is an Arcana card, the players win that Persona (they choose whose Stock it immediately enters). If it’s not, nothing happens. If you don’t have a tarot deck, number the Arcana and empty cards and roll 1d6 to determine the result (reroll if the number generated is higher than the number of cards).</p>

        <h2>Combat</h2>

        <h3>Rounds, Turns and Initiative</h3>

        <p>During combat, time is measured in Rounds and Turns. A Round ends when everyone in the battle has had their turn. During a turn you get two Actions: a Move Action and an Attack Action. You may swap your Attack Action for a Move Action but not vice versa. The order of turns is determine via an Initiative roll (2d6 + Agility). Whoever has the highest Initiative has their turn first in each Round.</p>

        <h4>Move Action</h4>

        <p>You may use a Move Action to: move up to 30 feet, swap Persona, use a consumable, remove the Down Ailment from yourself, interact with the environment (e.g. pulling a lever). Swapping Persona lets you change your currently equipped Persona to any in your Stock. When swapping you lose any buffs/debuffs and Ailments.</p>

        <h4>Attack Action</h4>

        <p>You may use an Attack Action to: Melee Attack, use a Skill, Defend. A Melee Attack can only be done within 5 feet of the target. Defending gives a +5 bonus to Defence, Magic Defence, Ranged Defence and a +2 bonus to Damage Reduction. There are three important parts of any type of attack: Accuracy, Damage and Defence. How each is calculated depends on the type of attack:
        For an Attack/Skill to hit, its Accuracy must be equal to or above the enemy’s Defence. If the Attack/Skill is successful calculate Damage (including Damage Reduction).</p>

        <h4>Damage Reduction</h4>

        <p>Damage from Attacks/Skills is reduced by your Endurance.</p>

        <h4>Critical Hit</h4>

        <p>If the result of 2d6 is 12 the Attack/Skill automatically hits and its damage is doubled (before Damage Reduction).</p>

        <h4>1 More!</h4>

        <p>If you use a Skill that an enemy is Weak to, it gains the Down Ailment and you can immediately get another Attack Action.</p>

        <h4>All-Out Attack</h4>

        <p>If all enemies are Down the Party gets an All-Out Attack. All PCs can move up to 30 feet towards enemies and make a Melee Attack simultaneously. This is not a turn.</p>

        <h2>Damage Types</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Melee/Ranged Attack/Physical Skill: Physical Magic Skill: Fire, Ice, Wind, Electric or Almighty </li>
        <li>Ailment Skill: Light, Dark or an ailment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ailments</h2>

        <p>You may only have one Ailment at a time and if you are given one when you already have one, the previous one is removed instantly (excluding Dead).</p>

        <h3>Rage (2 turns)</h3>

        <p>You can do nothing but Melee Attack the enemies nearest to you. If you aren’t within Melee Attack range you can only move towards the nearest enemy. Your Melee Damage is doubled and your Defence/Melee Accuracy is halved.</p>

        <h3>Dizzy (1 turn)</h3>

        <p>You cannot do anything during your next turn. You gain this Ailment when Down if an enemy Critically Hits you or an enemy hits you with a Skill you are Weak against. If you are hit by a normal attack while Down roll 1d6, if the result is 3 or below you gain this Ailment.</p>

        <h3>Confused (2 turns)</h3>

        <p>At the start of each turn roll 1d6. If the result is 3 or below you cannot do anything. If the result is 4 or above you may only attack.</p>

        <h3>Enervation (2 turns)</h3>

        <p>All of your Accuracies are halved.</p>

        <h3>Exhaustion (2 turns)</h3>

        <p>You lose 1 Spirit for every Action you perform. Damage received is multiplied by 1.5.</p>

        <h3>Fear (2 turns)</h3>

        <p>You must move as far as possible from whatever inflicted this ailment during your turn and cannot do anything else.</p>

        <h3>Poisoned (until removed or end of encounter)</h3>

        <p>Health decreases by 2 at the start of your turn. If this would bring your Health to or below 0 the Poisoned ailment does nothing (but is still applied, so if your Health goes above 2 but the Poisoned ailment hasn’t been removed it will continue to do damage).</p>

        <h3>Silence (2 turns)</h3>

        <p>You cannot use Skills or Swap Persona.</p>

        <h3>Dead (until removed or end of encounter)</h3>

        <p>You are Dead when your Health is 0 or less. You cannot do anything. At the end of battle you regain consciousness and return to 1 Health. The effects of the entire Party dying is up to GM discretion. Dead is not considered an ailment for the effects of Skills.</p>

        <h3>Down (1 turn)</h3>

        <p>Your Agility is 0 for the purpose of Defence. You do not get an attack action.</p>

        <h2>Weakness and Resistance</h2>

        <p>Personae and enemies have weaknesses and resistances. These define the effect of them being hit by damage of certain types. The types are: Physical, Fire, Ice, Electric, Wind, Light, Dark and Almighty. Light and Dark cannot be absorbed. The effect only occurs if the damage would be applied (missed attacks don’t trigger the resistance or weakness). Personae and shadows cannot have a weakness or resistance to Almighty damage.</p>

        <h3>Weak (wk)</h3>

        <p>You are now Down.
        Special: If Light or Dark, your defence against that type is 1d6 + LUCK (not 2d6 + LUCK).</p>

        <h3>Resist (rs)</h3>

        <p>Damage is halved.
        Special: If Light or Dark, your defence against that type is 3d6 + LUCK (not 2d6 + LUCK).</p>

        <h3>Null (nl)</h3>

        <p>No damage is received.</p>

        <h3>Reflect (rf)</h3>

        <p>Damage is applied to user.</p>

        <h3>Absorb (ab)</h3>

        <p>Damage is converted to healing.</p>

        <h1>Support NPC: Analyzer</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>We are living our lives abound with so much information</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Analyzer Support NPCs are willing to tag along with the Party, although unable to actually fight in battle. Analyzers can give the Party tactical advice about their surroundings and the enemies they face. This NPC uses their own Persona to empower their senses but cannot gain new Personae and their Persona has no Skills/Combat Attributes.</p>

        <h2>Analyze</h2>

        <p>During battle the Party can command the Analyzer to Analyze something. The Analysis is completed at the beginning of the round of combat. The Analyzer can be asked to Analyze the Party’s surroundings and enemies. For example, if you ask the Analyzer to Analyze stalactites on the ceiling of a cave they may point out they are fragile and could fall on the enemies if hit. Another example, Analyzing a wall may find a weak spot that can be broken through. As their Social Link Rank rises they attain higher powers of perception:</p>

        <h3>Social Link Rank 3</h3>

        <h1>Support NPC: Restorer</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>You don’t recognize this leaf from the normal local plant life...</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Restorer Support NPCs will go with the Party into the Shadow World but won’t accompany them any further, choosing to stay at a safe waypoint. Although they don’t directly assist in combat, they are very helpful when preparing/recovering from battle.</p>

        <h2>Restore</h2>

        <p>The Party may ask the Restorer to replenish their Spirit, for a cost. This is a boon because it allows you to restore Spirit if you run out of consumables but the price is quite hefty. As their Social Link Rank rises the price of restoration goes down:</p>
